## Features Added
### Feature 1: Navigating the Frog using a PC keyboard
We used a PC keyboard to send UART Commands to the board to navigate the frog around the map instead of a joystick that is integrated in the development board. The baud rate of the UART is set at 57600 Bd.
#### Navigating the Frog Up
The user can navigate the frog forward by pressing the 'w' key.

#### Navigating the Frog Down
The user can navigate the frog backward by pressing the 's' key.

### Feature 2: Pause/Resume option
We used a momentary pushbutton to pause/resume the game. The schematic below illustrates the pins and polarity of the pushbutton.

Based on this, we see that P2.12 (the board schematic has a typo â€“ it is not P2.22) can be used to read the state of two of the pushbuttons. If the button is pressed, will we read a '0' value at the pin.

Below are 2 pictures when the game is paused, and when the game is resumed.
